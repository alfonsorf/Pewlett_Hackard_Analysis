# Employee Database with SQL
## Purpose
In this module I was introduced to Structured Query Language or SQL, and how to use this tool to search through huge databases and obtain the information that I need with a short script and the click of a button. The purpose of this challenge was to create tables that contained information regarding employees who are eligible to retire from the company Pewlett Hackard. From six csv files that contained thousands of rows of information I filtered the data using multiple SQL statements such as DISTINCT ON and joins statements to combine the information that was needed for the analysis.

## Results
From the two tables I created, there are multiple takeaways:
- Out of the 90,000 employees that are eligible to retire, only 1,549 are eligible for a mentorship program. This was perhaps the most shocking result to me and the company will have a lot of work to make sure the remaining employees are fully trained.
- Almost 1/3 of the retiring staff is a Senior Engineer and close to another 1/3 of the retiring staff is a Senior Staff.
- Assuming all mentors are given the same amount of mentees, each mentor would have 323 employees to train. Pewlett Hackard will need an extremely efficient mentorship program for this to work.
- Lastly, Pewlett Hackard should focus their recruiting on hiring engineers since the largest portion of retirees will be Senior Engineers.

## Summary
From the analysis performed, you can see that 90,398 employees will have to be backfilled as the "silver tsunami" starts making an impact. Additionally, continuing from my third result above, there are not enough qualified and retirement ready employees that could train the next generation of employees. 
To provide some additional insight into the retirement data, one table that could be made would be one showing the year the employees plan to retire and from there make a plan to recruit new employees and train them to minimize the impact once they retire. Another table that would help Pewlett Hackard plan ahead would be one containing data on the younger employees who will be eligible for promotions and begin training them to become the next senior employees, even without knowing the exact date of retirement.
